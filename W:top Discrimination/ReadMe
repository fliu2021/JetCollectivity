This code aims to discriminate jets initiated by a W or top quarks. There two ways to achieve that.
First is that using softdrop , and see jet mass afer applying softdrop .
1.cd SoftDropMass 
2.make 
3./new_default_data_vn


Second is that using N-subjettiness ,and see tau3/tau2 , tau2/tau1
1.cd N_subjettiness 
2.make 
3./new_default_data_vn




***********REMEMBER*******************
Make you have install pythia8 and fastjet3.and modify makefile to let g++ locate them
Also remember to modify input rootfile address and output rootfile address.
